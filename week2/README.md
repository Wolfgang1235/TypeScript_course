<h1>Exercise 1:</h1>
<p>In the folder 'callbacks', I have created the file callbacks.js which has the functions listed in order.</p>
<h1>Exercise 2:</h1>
<p>In the folder 'promises', I have created the file promises.js which has the functions listed in order.</p>
<p>Assigment 2.d has me chain all the math functions one by one, using the .then method. It is possible for me to do 
this, because I use the phenomenon called callback-hell. I nest multiple callbacks within one function. It is not a 
very effective way to write code asynchronously.</p>
<h1>Exercise 3:</h1>
<p>In my weather.js file I have written the code down from the assignment. My api key have I replaced with 
a string "key", so that it cannot be used, when I push to my repository. In the file weather.js are the functions 
listed in order.</p>
<h1>Exercise 4:</h1>
<p>For exercise all I had to do was follow the assignment text. The only troubling part was to remember allowing my
browser to track my location, in order for the function to print out in html page, what the temperature is.</p>
