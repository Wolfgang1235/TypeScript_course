<p>For part 1</p>
https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-nwivgi?file=src%2Fcounter.ts,src%2Fgreet.ts,src%2Fmain.ts&terminal=dev

<p>I don't know if the command: </p>
vite init project-name -- --template vanilla-ts
<p>has been executed correctly, and if I have missed the point of part 2.</p>

<p>For part 3, I can't print the list of people into my html file because of export errors in my console, 
when in a browser.</p>
